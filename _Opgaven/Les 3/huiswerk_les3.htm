<b>Benefits</b>
<ul>
<li>Same keyboard commands as Eclipse</li>

</ul>

<p>To do web development in Eclipse, you should first go to the marketplace and get WTP, aka the Web Tool Platform. This plug-in offers a lot of very useful functionality. But it's not perfect. The WTP is missing a few things that you'll quickly notice as you do your work.</p>

<p>Aptana's Eclipse plug-in can help fill in the gaps. This web page will give you a quick run-down on how to get this plug-in and what it offers. The Aptana website boasts that the plug-in is useful for development with Javascript, Ruby on Rails, PHP and Pythonâ€”in addition to CSS and HTML.</p>
